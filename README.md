# EEP-153-Project-1_Group-Atwater
Spring 22

**Topic: Cost comparison of a minimized vegetarian diet for Berkeley residents across 5 different
local grocery stores (Safeway, Trader Joe’s, Amazon Fresh, Berkeley Bowl, Sprout’s).**

Please download the python notebook and upload it into the eep153 project 2 folder on DataHub.

IMPORTANT: if you run into an API Error (for any of the function below), it is due to the stability of the server. Try rerunning the “import data libraies” cell and the func- tion cell again; try reinitializing student.json with the “noodle octopus” passphrase; try restarting the kernel; or trying to replace the API key with your own. Unfortunately, it is possible for the problem to persist :(
